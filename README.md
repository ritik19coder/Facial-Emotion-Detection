# Facial-Emotion-Detection
Emotion detection models have gained significant attention in recent years due 
to their crucial role in enhancing human-computer interaction and sentiment 
analysis applications. This paper presents an overview of the current landscape 
of emotion detection models, emphasizing their evolution from traditional rulebased approaches to advanced deep learning techniques.
The review encompasses a comprehensive examination of various datasets, 
methodologies, and evaluation metrics commonly used in emotion detection 
research. It also highlights the challenges and limitations faced by existing 
models, including the handling of ambiguous emotions and cross-cultural 
differences.
Moreover, this abstract discusses potential future directions for emotion 
detection models, including the integration of multimodal data sources (text, 
audio, and video), fine-grained emotion classification, and the ethical 
implications of deploying such models in real-world scenerios.
